meta: Yet another development blog on the Internet...

I have setup this dev' blog so I can keep track of things I learn every now and then. But instead of keeping it to myself, I thought I could actually share it with other developers.

I will mainly write about stuff/tips/pieces of code about Linux (Ubuntu), PHP, Symfony, MySQL and probably other web languages.

Regarding this blog, it is written in [markdown], running under [jekyll] and hosted by [github].
